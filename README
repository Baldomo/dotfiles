# Baldomo's dotfiles #

Welcome to my dotfiles repo :)


#### Dependencies ####
---
- [Wal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/wal)
- [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3) (duh)
- Font: [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka)
- i3-lock (pretty locking script taken from [reddit](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn))
- Compton
- Conky
- Scrot
- *Bash* (Conky won't parse Xres colors as the conky-getcolors script uses bash's string separation)


#### Suggestions ####
---
Place/link the lockscreen script in /bin so the i3 config can easily run it

##### Enjoy! #####
